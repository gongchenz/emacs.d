# General

I base my emacs.d on [Steve Purcell's emacs.d](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) and synchronize from his once a month.

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the 'init.el' contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el and old ~/.emacs does NOT exist.

Thanks to Purcell, this emacs.d has
[fancy features](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) for most script
languages like Clojure, Python, Lisp, PHP, Javascript, Ruby
etc. Purcell is basically a web geek who use all the modern web
technologies.

I will support all the languages a desktop developer may use, like
C++, Java, Lua, Objective-C etc.

## Features

* git or subversion is NOT needed. I removed all the 'git submodule update' stuff.
* enhance major/minor modes for C/C++ developers
* optimized for cross-platform C++ development with CMake and wxWidgets
* emacs-w3m (console browser)
* eim (Chinese pinyin input method)
* org2blog (write wordpress blog with org-mode)
* make the configuration work under Linux and Cygwin
* The configuration will work with Emacs version >=23.3.1
* evil-mode and its plugins (Vim key binding)
* yasnippet and my customized snippets
* start up WITHOUT heavy weight plugins (OPTIONAL)

## Third party CLI tools Emacs uses

Purcell won't list all the 3rd party tools this configuration dependent on. I will
try to list them HERE,

* w3m (web browser in console)
* jsl (jslint)
* aspell, and dictionary (aspell-en, for example)
* sbcl (lisp environment)
* tidy (html tidy program)
* csslint (install node.js, then `npm install -g csslint`
* zip and unzip
  export org to odt
* clang
  intellisense of C++ code need clang (http://clang.llvm.org)
* ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net)
  You use ctags to navigate the code.
* GNU Global (http://www.gnu.org/software/global)
  You use this tool to navigate the C/C++/Java/Objective-C code.
* pyflakes
  You need pyflakes for real time python syntax check (flymake-python)

Install pip, then `pip install pyflakes`, but on cygwin you need install
  setuptool in order to install pip.
* ditaa, grapviz and planetuml to convert ascii art to diagram and uml.

To install the tools, I suggest using,
* apt-cyg at Cygwin
* homebrew at OS X
* any package manager at Linux

Please note it's totally fine you don't install these CLI tools. Emacs won't crash. ;)
## Report bug
If you find any bug, please file an issue on the github project:
https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d

## Tips
* by default EVIL (Vim emulation in Emacs) is used. You can comment out
 line containing "(require 'init-evil)" in init.el to unload it.
* Some package cannot be downloaded automatically because of network problem.
You need manually `M-x list-packages` and install it.
* I downgraded the yasnippet to an older version because latest yasnippet is
not compatible with auto-complete.
* You can speed up the start up by NOT loading some heavy weight
  components like evil or yasnippet. All you need to do is add below
  code into ~/.bashrc:
  ```sh
  alias e=emacs -q --no-splash --eval="(setq light-weight-emacs t)" -l "$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el"
  ```

## My personal custom.el
It's publicized at http://blog.binchen.org/?p=430 .
